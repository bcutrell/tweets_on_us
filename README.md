Tweets On Us
=============
Tweets On Us is a twitter aggregator created for those in the Launch Academy circles. 

Due to a large social network, it is hard to keep track of what is being mentioned and shared on Twitter, but with Tweets On Us any fellow tweeter can see who is saying what about Launch Academy in the peripheral community.
Tweeters are categorized into groups, allowing for easier navigation and filtering.

This web app uses the Twitter REST API v1.1 to pull tweets posted within the last 30 days.
